          <h2>Back Pain</h2>
          <p>Back pain can range from just an annoying ache to constant and severe pain. It can prevent people from having mobility and interfering with normal functioning in life. Neck pain occurs in the cervical vertebrae in the neck. It leaves it unprotected and easy to get injured. This can be acute and lasys for weeks, months, or years.</p>
          <p>Back and neck pain can be eased up on the pressure the patient has been putting on their back. Many people have a minor choice in that matter. The pain will force them to drop to their knees or get into a bent-over position. Others would be able to function normally, but with uncomfortable pain. Acute back pain will show days of restricting activity and taking the appropriate medication. They can also get massages or apply ice for 48 hours. A limited movement of muscles and joints is more effective to treat simple back pain than passive methods.</p>
